This Refund and Cancellation Policy explains the rules and conditions under which refunds or cancellations may be requested for courses purchased on our platform. By enrolling in any course, you agree to comply with the terms outlined in this policy.
</p>

<p className="mt-5">
Once a course is purchased and access is granted, cancellations are generally not permitted. Users are encouraged to review course details carefully before completing a purchase to ensure the course meets their expectations.
</p>

<p className="mt-5">
Refund requests will only be considered in exceptional cases such as duplicate payments, technical errors, or incorrect charges. Any approved refund will be processed using the original method of payment within a reasonable timeframe.
</p>

<p className="mt-5">
We reserve the right to deny refund or cancellation requests if course content has been accessed, downloaded, or completed in part or in full. Misuse of the refund policy may result in account suspension or restriction.
</p>

<p className="mt-5">
This policy may be updated periodically without prior notice. Continued use of the website after any changes signifies acceptance of the revised Refund and Cancellation Policy. Users are advised to review this section regularly for updates.
